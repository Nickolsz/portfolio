							<p>During college me and my friends liked to have movies nights at least 2-3 times a month, but the hardest part about this was always trying to agree on what movie. At this same time I was in a foundations of programming class where I was learning how to code, so I felt like there was no better oppourtunity than now to make a python script to solve the problem of picking a movie. As an avid movie fan I have used LetterBoxd for years, and have built a very long watchlist. However one thing that has always bother me about LetterBoxd is the inability to randomly choose a movie from that watchlist. This is where I finally birthed the idea for this project.</p>
							<p>This project allowed me to not only hoan my skills in python, but allowed me to learn, and build a very big sub-genre of python coding known as web scraping. To get all of the movies from LetterBoxd, and IMDB I had to scrape the data from the relevant sites. While API's would have made this code faster, LetterBoxd's API is private at the moment. So instead I coded a web scraper for both LetterBoxd's website, and IMDB as well. From there I stored all of the movie titles from each list, and then would randomly select however many were requested by the user.</p>
