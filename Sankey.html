							<p>As we all know the job hunt is a long and winding road. Constantly sending applications, and receiving emails back whether it be just for the application, a rejection, an interview, or even an offer if you are lucky. This often leads to a full inbox, and keeping track of your progress quickly becomes hard to do with so many emails pouring in. While scrolling Reddit one day I saw a user post a chart along with the title "I finally got a job after 1000 applications." The chart they had used was a sankey graph, which is used to present flows. I loved this idea of keeping track of the ongoing flow of my job hunt, but the thought of manually entering in all of the data was terrible. This is what spawned the idea for this project. </p>
							<p>I instead decided to develop an automated data pipeline that would read, classify, and and automatically create this sankey graph from my job application inbox. To fully flesh out and complete this project I had to use tools like Python, SKLearn libraries and a PostgreSQL database. This project allowed me to apply the knowledge I learened about database creation, and management from my degree, while also continuing to teach myself how to use Python.</p>
